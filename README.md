# Minesweeper
The classic Minesweeper made from scratch with C++ in Qt, using object-oriented programming as well as implementing into a GUI framework for an incredible user experience. 
# How to Play
Left click to reveal cells, and right click to flag them.  The difficulties include easy (a 5x5 board with 4 mines), medium (a 9x9 board with 10 mines), and hard (a 16x16 board with 40 mines).  The cells, when revealed, display the amount of mines that are directly adjacent to them.
# Lessons Learned
Making this project helped me to develop my object oriented programming skills as well as learn more about C++ and interfacing the game logic with a GUI framework like Qt.
